# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

I decided to use ChatGPT to get some projects in my skill level that I would be able to do and learn from. 
This is what it gave me after prompting it for projects to help with bacic gui and data science skills:


" 
Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization
Languages: Python

Objective
Analyze a dataset and create visualizations to uncover insights.

Steps
Choose a Dataset: Use a dataset from sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or a public API.
Data Cleaning: Write Python code to clean and preprocess the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn to explore the data and create visualizations.
Simple GUI: Create a basic GUI using Tkinter (built-in Python library) to allow users to select different visualizations.
Skills Learned
Data preprocessing
Data visualization
Basic GUI development

This will be my first time working in python for a project and hopefully will be able to learn it quickly.
